I see the issue now. The processor is returning None for some fields. Let me check the structure of the inputs that the model expects:Yes, I found the key information. The Phi-4 model defines input modes in an enum class as follows:
```python
class InputMode(Enum):
    LANGUAGE = 0  # Text-only mode
    VISION = 1    # Vision+text mode 
    SPEECH = 2    # Speech+text mode
    VISION_SPEECH = 3  # Vision+speech+text mode
```

When using the processor, it automatically detects the mode based on the inputs provided:
- If just text -> LANGUAGE (0)
- If images -> VISION (1) 
- If audio -> SPEECH (2)
- If both images and audio -> VISION_SPEECH (3)

Let me run the updated test again:
