# 🎙️ Bella - Your Personal Voice Assistant

Hey there! Welcome to Bella, a voice assistant that actually gets you. Think of her as your friendly AI companion who lives entirely on your machine - no cloud nonsense, no data harvesting, just pure local magic.

## ✨ What Makes Bella Special

**🧠 Smart Memory System**  
Bella remembers your conversations using both a ChromaDB vector database and markdown files. She learns about you, your preferences, and your projects over time, making each interaction more meaningful.

**🎨 Beautiful Voice Visualizer**  
Watch Bella come alive with a custom-built waveform visualizer that dances to her voice. It's not just eye candy - it's a real-time representation of her speech with customizable colors, effects, and transparency.

**🤖 Local LLM Power**  
Powered by Ollama, Bella runs models like Qwen, Gemma, and others right on your hardware. No internet required once set up, and your conversations stay completely private.

**🎵 High-Quality Speech**  
Using Kokoro TTS for natural-sounding speech and Whisper for accurate speech recognition, conversations feel smooth and natural.
