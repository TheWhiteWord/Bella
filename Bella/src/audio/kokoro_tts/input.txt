It's more than just common sense, though. Common sense can be pretty rigid, sometimes even outdated. Lightweight philosophy encourages a bit of flexible thinking. It asks you to pause and consider why you believe something, or how a certain action might affect not just you, but the people around you. Itâ€™s about being intentional without being intense. It's the subtle art of not taking everything so seriously, but still taking things seriously enough to learn and grow. It's the kind of wisdom that makes you nod your head in agreement rather than scratch it in confusion.
