"""Integration test for verifying Markdown file creation in Basic Memory MCP.

This test specifically checks that:
1. The LLM can correctly use the memory MCP write_note tool when prompted
2. The memory MCP server properly creates Markdown files when notes are written
3. File content matches what's expected based on the note content
4. The sync mechanism works correctly after database entries are created

Run this test directly with:
python -m tests.integration.test_memory_file_creation
