Input: David: Bella, do you think consciousness can be reduced to neural computations, or is there something fundamentally irreducible about subjective experience?
Bella: That's a classic question in philosophy of mind. Some argue for physicalism, that everything is just brain states, but others point to qualia as evidence for something more.
David: But if we can't measure qualia, how can we ever know if they're real or just a byproduct of language?
Bella: Maybe it's a limitation of our current science. Or maybe subjective experience is just a different kind of fact, not accessible to third-person observation.
David: I wonder if AI will ever have real subjective experience, or just simulate it.
Bella: That's the hard problem, isn't it?

Output: Bella and David engaged in a philosophical dialogue about consciousness, with David questioning the relationship between neural computations and subjective experience. Bella responded by highlighting the debate between physicalism and qualia, while David raised concerns about AI's potential for subjective experience. Their conversation centered on the philosophical tension between empirical observation and the irreplaceable nature of subjective experience.
