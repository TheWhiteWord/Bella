Input: David: Bella, do you think consciousness can be reduced to neural computations, or is there something fundamentally irreducible about subjective experience?
Bella: That's a classic question in philosophy of mind. Some argue for physicalism, that everything is just brain states, but others point to qualia as evidence for something more.
David: But if we can't measure qualia, how can we ever know if they're real or just a byproduct of language?
Bella: Maybe it's a limitation of our current science. Or maybe subjective experience is just a different kind of fact, not accessible to third-person observation.
David: I wonder if AI will ever have real subjective experience, or just simulate it.
Bella: That's the hard problem, isn't it?

Output: Bella and David discussed their upcoming project plans, both expressing excitement and a shared sense of purpose. David asked Bella about consciousness and subjective experience, prompting a philosophical discussion on the nature of reality and perception.
