# Memory System To-Do List

1. **Enhanced error handling**: Although we've added basic error handling, you might want to make it more robust for production use

2. **LLM-based importance evaluation**: Currently, we use a simple heuristic for scoring memory importance. In the future, you could use an LLM for more sophisticated importance evaluation

3. **Vector store optimization**: For large memory collections, you might want to implement a more efficient vector storage solution like ChromaDB or DuckDB. (only open source solutions)

4. **Memory pruning**: Add functionality to automatically prune less important memories when the storage gets too large

The new memory system with the nomic-embed-text embedding model is now fully integrated and functional. The tests confirm that all components work together as expected, providing Bella with enhanced memory capabilities that will improve its conversational abilities significantly.
