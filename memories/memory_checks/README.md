# ChromaDB Inspection Tool
This tool is designed to help you inspect and manage your ChromaDB memory database. It provides various commands to check the status of your memory files, list all memories, search for specific memories, export memory data, visualize memory embeddings, and fix any missing files.
## How to Use the Inspection Tool

Now you should be able to successfully run the stats command:

```bash
python chroma_inspect.py stats
#or
cd /media/theww/AI/Code/AI/Bella/Bella/src/memory/memory_checks
python chroma_inspect.py stats
```

You can also explore your ChromaDB with these other useful commands:

1. **List all memories**:
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py list
   ```

2. **Search for specific memories**:
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py search "your search query"
   ```

3. **Export all memory data**:
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py dump --output memories_export.json
   ```

4. **Visualize memory embeddings**:
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py visualize --output memory_visualization.png
   ```

5. **Fix missing files** (fixes file paths in ChromaDB if files have moved):
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py fix --dry-run  # Check what would be fixed without making changes
   python chroma_inspect.py fix  # Actually fix the file paths
   ```

6. **Remove missing files** (removes entries from ChromaDB if files are missing):
   ```bash
   python chroma_inspect.py fix --remove-missing  # Remove entries for missing files
   python chroma_inspect.py fix --dry-run --remove-missing  # Check what would be removed without making changes
   ```

7. **Sync memory files with ChromaDB** (updates file paths in ChromaDB):
   ```bash
    python chroma_inspect.py sync  # Sync memory files with ChromaDB
    python chroma_inspect.py sync --dry-run  # Check what would be synced without making changes
   ```


##  Remove Missing Files 

I've enhanced the `fix_missing_files` method to include a `remove_missing` parameter. Here's what the new functionality does:

1. When you use `--remove-missing` with the `fix` command, the tool will:
   - First try to find if the file has moved to another location (the existing behavior)
   - If the file can't be found anywhere, it will remove the entry from ChromaDB entirely

2. The method now returns three values instead of two:
   - `fixed_count`: Number of entries whose file paths were updated
   - `removed_count`: Number of entries removed from ChromaDB
   - `failed_count`: Number of entries that couldn't be fixed or removed

Now I need to update the command-line interface to expose this new functionality:
```
    # Fix command
    fix_parser = subparsers.add_parser('fix', help='Find and fix missing files')
    fix_parser.add_argument('--dry-run', action='store_true', help="Don't make any changes, just report")
    fix_parser.add_argument('--remove-missing', action='store_true', help="Remove entries from ChromaDB when their files are missing")
    
```
I've updated the `chroma_inspect.py` tool to add the functionality you requested. Now you can use it to remove entries from ChromaDB when the corresponding Markdown files have been deleted.

## How to Use It

If you delete a Markdown file from your memory directory, you can now use the following command to remove the corresponding entry from ChromaDB:

```bash
python chroma_inspect.py fix --remove-missing
```

This will:
1. Check all entries in ChromaDB
2. Try to find entries whose files no longer exist
3. Remove these entries from the database

## Safe Testing with Dry Run

If you want to see what would be removed before making any changes, you can use:

```bash
python chroma_inspect.py fix --dry-run --remove-missing
```

This will show you which entries would be removed without actually changing anything.

## What the Tool Does

The tool now has three main behaviors:
1. If a file exists at its recorded location: do nothing
2. If a file has moved to another memory directory: update the path in ChromaDB
3. If a file is completely missing: remove the entry from ChromaDB (only with `--remove-missing`)

This ensures your ChromaDB stays in sync with your actual Markdown files, preventing "phantom" entries that refer to deleted files.

## Use Case Example

Let's say you deleted a memory file at `Bella/memories/general/outdated-memory.md`:

1. Run `python chroma_inspect.py fix --remove-missing`
2. The tool will:
   - See that the file for this memory no longer exists
   - Remove the corresponding entry from ChromaDB
3. Your memory system is now consistent again

This way, when you search for memories, you won't get references to files that no longer exist.
